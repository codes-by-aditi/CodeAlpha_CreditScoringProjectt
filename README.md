## 📌 Project Description

This project implements **supervised machine learning models** to analyze and predict whether a client is likely to be **approved or denied credit** based on historical financial data.

Credit scoring systems are widely used by banks and financial organizations to assess lending risk.  
Typically, a credit score ranges from **300 to 850**, where a higher score indicates a lower risk for lenders.

The objective of this project is to understand the **logic behind credit scoring models** and explore how different features influence credit approval decisions.

## 📊 Features Considered

The model works with both **numerical and categorical features**, including:

- Credit amount  
- Existing credit history  
- Account status  
- Number of previous credits  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand the credit scoring process used by financial institutions  
- Apply supervised machine learning algorithms  
- Train and evaluate classification models  
- Analyze key risk factors affecting credit approval  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook
