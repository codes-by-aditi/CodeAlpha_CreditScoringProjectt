📘 Project Type: Academic / Learning Project

## Description
This project implements supervised machine learning techniques to understand
how financial institutions evaluate credit risk. The goal is to predict whether
a client is likely to be granted or denied credit based on historical financial data.

Credit scoring is widely used by banks and financial organizations to assign
a numerical score to individuals, typically ranging from 300 to 850.
A higher score indicates lower risk for lenders.

The model considers both numerical and categorical features such as:
- Credit amount
- Existing credit history
- Account status
- Number of previous credits

---

## Objectives
- Understand the credit scoring process
- Apply supervised machine learning algorithms
- Train and evaluate classification models
- Analyze risk factors affecting credit approval

---

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

## Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
